# Data-Analysis-project
This is simple Data analysis Project where i have used skills of python and its libraries like pandas, matplotlib and numpy for hotel reservation cancelations.
The short description of problem that hotels are facing goes like this

Business Problem
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotel’s primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer through business advice to address this problem.
